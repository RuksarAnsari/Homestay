<h1 class=head>About Us<h1>
<p><b>
HOMESTAYS is a platform exclusively dedicated to promote homestays across India.​ 
We aim at providing travelers a unique cultural experience and work towards developing local community while 
preserving their heritage, culture and traditions.

Living in a homestay means you live in a social informal setting where you get an 
opportunity to experience the local culture & traditions and interact with your hosts and co-travelers. 
It gives you an enriching and immersive experience.  
Homestay owners host their spaces in many different ways, which makes each homestay experience unique and full of discovery.</b>
</p>

<h1>OUR AIM<h1>

<p>To provide a platform to Home Stays that are located in heavenly places and need more visibility.
To provide information to the Travelers who are looking for advice, 
tips and way to find a good Home Stay in India.
To upgrade the quality of Home Stays in India, help them understand and implement 
the eco-tourism practices and support them to grow.
Homestays have huge potential to grow and contribute to sustainable tourism in India. 
They just need to be educated and trained in hospitality, cooking, cleanliness, 
adopting eco-friendly practices and for a better life. 
They just need to be connected to the outer world. 
This is where we play an important role. We created a platform to bring travellers and homestays together through this website. 
This help travelers book online and the homestays get frequent traffic. We send teams of volunteers to train hosts 
in different aspects of hospitality. We aim not only at  
improving the overall lifestyle of the host but also at supporting the local community by 
encouraging and training women of the house to be actively involved in managing the homestay, 
creating outlets for local produce and handicrafts in every homestay and promoting local traditions and culture.</p>
